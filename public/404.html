    /*
      512 MAGICAL BYTES
      This is, hands down, one of the strangest quirks I 
      have ever encountered in web development. You must 
      ensure that the total size of your 404.html page is 
      greater than 512 bytes, because if it isn’t, Internet 
      Explorer will disregard it and show a generic browser 
      404 page instead. When I finally figured this out, I 
      had to crack open a beer to cope with the amount of 
      time it took.
